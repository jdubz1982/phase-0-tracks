# Plan
* Before I started Phase 0, I was trying to get as much of the Odin Project completed as possible. I felt like it gave me a very strong base from which to build on when I actually started Phase 0. 
* I plan on working through Codeacademy's jQuery Track and Code School's jQuery track as well. They also have a Javascript/jQuery challenge that might be interesting to complete.
