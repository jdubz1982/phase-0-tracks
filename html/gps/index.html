What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to give your content meaning and structure by using the correct element to build your page. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content. Semantic elements also help computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices adequately read the content on a web page. Once you figure it out, I think semantic HTML is easier to work with, as it shows what each piece of content is about. 

So far I have found the header, nav, section, and footer tags to be the most useful. As I become more accustomed to HTML and build more meaningful websites, I am sure I will be using all of them. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser will load HTML elements top to bottom. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I knew that if I typed html and hit tab that it would load the basic HTML layout code. That being said I did not know that it was called a snippet or how to make one. I will definitely be creating more snippets as I go along. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I think the most challenging concept was building a web page by memory and using the correct semantic elements. I generally now know what each element does, but it is tough to put them on a page without referencing some documentation or sample code. Building a table and thinking about the rows and columns was probably the most difficult. As I build more web pages and practice more it will become easier.
