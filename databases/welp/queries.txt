1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|5|Awesome venue|1|1
4|Steven|Wonder|2|Amir's Towing|2|0|Stole my car|2|4
2|Mandy|Kaling|3|The Beagle Nightclub|3|3|OK beer|3|2
3|Angela|Jolie|4|Lotus Yoga|4|4|Incredible poses|4|3

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id AND businesses.name = "Amir's Towing";
